<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen we start developing software, it's normal to draw inspiration from an existing idea. It could be a well-designed screen, a great user experience, or a successful case study.</p>

I believe this is a common characteristic when it comes to desktop, web, or mobile development. After all, who hasn't heard something like this:

<blockquote>In system XYZ, when you send a photo, it's possible to crop it right there in the system... I want the same feature in our system...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Do you see this website here? Look, it's using these beautiful and modern buttons... I want the same for our website...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Did you notice in WhatsApp, when someone reads a message, those two blue ticks appear... I want the same in our app...</blockquote>

Taking this into consideration, I'm planning a series of posts to talk about "how to do" a certain feature from a well-known application. Since I've been working with Xamarin.Forms for almost two years, the posts will focus on using it for Android and iOS applications.

And why is that??? I know many people use Xamarin.Forms, and these people either really love or really hate the framework. I'm one of those who like the framework, but that's because I understood that it has its limitations, and if you know how to deal with them and develop some workarounds when necessary, you'll do well.

So, folks, my posts will focus on showing "how to do" some things that are not standard in the framework. I hope you like them.

I'll start publishing soon. Hugs!
