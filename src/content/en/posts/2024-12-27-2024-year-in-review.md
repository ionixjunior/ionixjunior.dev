<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore the end of the year seems like the perfect moment to reflect on what we did throughout the year. I believe this is the first year I've done this reflection, and I'll share some of my thoughts with you. Let's talk about 2024 from my career perspective.</p>

## Blog Posts

Since January, I've started writing on my blog again. Initially, I chose a topic I enjoy immensely: Git. I wrote many posts discussing Git commands. I also wrote posts about iOS development and career development. I like sharing content, but the best part is interacting with you through comments. So, thank you to everyone who interacts with me by commenting on posts both on the blog and on [LinkedIn][my_linkedin].

## Live Streaming

This year I didn't create any live streams on my [YouTube][my_youtube] and [Twitch][my_twitch] channels, but I participated in six live streams on the [Canal .NET][canal_dotnet] and [Azure Brasil][azure_brasil] channels. I appreciated all these opportunities, and I'd like to express my gratitude for them.

Here are the links to these live streams:

- [Automating the Build and Deployment of Mobile Apps in Practice! - First Edition][live_1]
- [Automating the Build and Deployment of Mobile Apps in Practice! - Second Edition][live_2]
- [Automating the Build and Deployment of Mobile Apps in Practice! - Third Edition][live_3]
- [.NET Conf 2024: .NET 9, C# 13, MAUI, ASP.NET, Blazor - First Edition][live_4]
- [.NET Conf 2024: .NET 9, C# 13, MAUI, ASP.NET, Blazor - Second Edition][live_5]
- [Multiplatform Development with .NET MAUI][live_6]

## Podcast

This year, a colleague, Fernando Okuma, invited me to participate in an episode of the Lambda3 podcast. It was an amazing experience to talk with him about Git. Thank you so much for inviting me! Below is the link:

## Study on iOS Development

In 2024, I dedicated time to learning and practicing iOS development. I found a lot of great content, and I'll share some of it with you.

### Courses

I took several long and short courses.

#### Backfront Plus

First, I started a course at [Backfront Plus][backfront_plus]. This platform contains many excellent courses about mobile development, and I found amazing content there. UIKit, ViewCode, and SwiftUI are some examples. If you're looking for good content at a fair price, this is the platform. Just for the record: this isn't a paid post. This is a genuine recommendation. I really liked this platform.

#### Functional Programming with Swift

Good content that I found on LinkedIn Learning was the short course called [Learning Functional Programming with Swift][learning_functional_programming_with_swift]. This course was very simple but very effective for understanding and practicing functional programming using Swift.

#### iOS Development: Architecture

In this course, I learned about fundamental architectural design patterns, SOLID principles, how to build responsive apps, and more concepts about iOS development. It was a good course for learning many details applied to the platform. If you're interested, here's the link: [iOS Development: Architecture][ios_development_architecture].

#### 100 Days of SwiftUI

Another great resource that I used extensively was from Paul Hudson. I started the [100 Days of SwiftUI][100_days_of_swiftui] course, but unfortunately, I haven't finished it yet. After I moved to Brasília, my routine changed, and I needed to rethink my study plan. But if you're looking for great free content, this is it.

### Book

I read an excellent book called [Testing Swift][testing_swift] by Paul Hudson. I highly recommend it. This book is easy to read, understand, and has great examples. It's incredible how easy it can be to test iOS apps, and this book helps a lot with that.

I did other reading as well, but it wasn't technical, so I won't describe it here.

### Open-Source Contribution

Unlike previous years, I didn't start any clone app projects this year. Instead, I started contributing to an open-source project, programming in real software. I found a welcoming community in the [Firefox iOS][firefox_ios] project and jumped in.

I started contributing with small pull requests, of course. My first pull request refactored a font reference, and then I started resolving some linter issues.  I continue helping with linter issues, but I'm now committed to a large refactor, which has been an amazing experience, and I'm learning a lot from this great team.

Throughout the year, I made more than 40 pull requests, helping the Firefox iOS team enable some linter rules, make font updates, and resolve a flaky unit test.  Thank you to all Firefox iOS team members for your patience and for helping me achieve these goals! You're all doing great work and have a well-organized project.

## Study on CI/CD

Recently, I faced some challenges using Azure DevOps Pipelines to build an app, and I found a course on Udemy called [Azure Pipelines - CI/CD, Docker and Kubernetes in Azure DevOps][azure_pipelines]. This is a good course for understanding Azure Pipelines, from beginner to advanced topics.  I didn't complete all the lessons, as I needed help with a very specific topic, but if you need more advanced information, this is a great course to check out.

## Leaving Team Leadership

2024 was a year of another career change. Since 2020, I've been working as a team leader.  In this role, I faced many challenges, which helped me grow significantly in soft skills — communication, difficult conversations, emotional intelligence, time management, team management, and delegation. I feel these skills are sometimes neglected by developers, but they contribute significantly to career growth, especially for those who work from home.

After this period of leading a team, I felt the need to refocus on my personal growth in my tech career. So, since the end of 2023, I've been discussing this with my leadership, and we created a plan to find another leader for the team, allowing me to return to focusing on mobile development.  Now, at the end of 2024, we've found someone, and this will allow me to finalize my plan at the beginning of 2025.

## 2025 is Coming

2024 is ending, and 2025 is coming. Now is the best time to reflect on everything we've done, what worked and what didn't, and think about the next year, ensuring we choose a path that makes sense for us.

Thank you for your attention, and see you next year!
