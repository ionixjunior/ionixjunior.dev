Recently, Microsoft announced that the Xamarin platform is available for free to developers.

If you already had your Xamarin trial license, you can now convert it to the community edition and develop your applications without the previous restrictions.

This will undoubtedly encourage many developers to use the platform. With that in mind, I will be dedicating myself to writing some tutorials in the coming weeks that I have been preparing for almost a year since I started working with Xamarin.

Stay tuned for updates. Thank you!
