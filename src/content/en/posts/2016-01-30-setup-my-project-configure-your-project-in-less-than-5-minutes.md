This tip is intended for Java developers and it's called SetupMyProject.

Imagine a web application that streamlines project setup based on the options selected in a configuration wizard. Well, [SetupMyProject][project] does exactly that.

With this tool, we can easily create a Java project by simply selecting the desired MVC framework, Java version, database, plugins, and a few other fine-tuning adjustments.

The available options for project configuration include:

#### MVC Frameworks
* Spring
* JSF
* VRaptor
* Vaadin

#### Java Version
* Java 7
* Java 8

#### Database
* MySQL 5
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SQL Server

#### Plugins
* Spring Security
* Spring JPA
* PrimeFaces
* JPA
* CDI

At the end of the process, the project is available for download, ready to be opened in Eclipse. Maven will take care of downloading all the necessary dependencies to make the project ready. Simple and very practical!

Need to create a new Java project? Give this option a try, it's worth it!
