Last Wednesday, October 15, 2014, I was at Cat√≥lica SC for the GDG Academic Week BSI 2014 event, where I gave a presentation on software quality tools.

As it was a quick talk, the presentation covers only some of the main tools for software quality control.

The presentation can be found [here][presentation].

During the presentation, there are some parts where I demonstrate the use of the tools. The code used in the examples can be found on [GitHub][repository].

Finally, I would like to thank the event organizers for granting me this opportunity.
