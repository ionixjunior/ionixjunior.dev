This is the repository for [my blog](https://ionixjunior.dev).

Initially, my blog was built with Jekyll, based on the [Long Haul](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul) theme by [@brianmaierjr](https://x.com/brianmaierjr).

Recently, I migrated my blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I have customized it to retain the amazing Long Haul style.
