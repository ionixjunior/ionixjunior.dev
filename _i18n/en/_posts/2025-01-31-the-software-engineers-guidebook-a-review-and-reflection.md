<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> believe that's not so difficult to understand what works or not to be sucessfull in our careers, but sometimes we need some guidance to go ahead. So, I dedicated time to read "The Software Engineer's Guidebook", and I'll share with you a short review and some of my throughts about it, based on my career perspective and experience being a Software Engineer and leading a Team.</p>

## About the book

The title called ["The Software Engineer's Guidebook - Navigating Senior, Tech Lead, and Staff Engineer Positions at Tech Companies and Startups"][eng_guidebook] is a book from [Gergely Orosz][gergely_orosz], writer of [The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter][eng_newsletter]. 

In this book, Gergely share a lot of perceptions and tips, based on his experience. From my point of view, this content is a great opportunity to understand the key points to be successful in your career.

Don't worry, because I'll care about to not expose spoilers to you, okay? But I believe some of them will be inevitable, but I'll do my best.

## My thoughts

I'll share with you some of my thoughts. Let's get start.

### Good advices to grow

I didn't feel this book reveals a big surprise to me. Most things that I read, actually, I understand as a basic behavior that a Software Engineer must have. 

I believe the last five years acting as a Team Leader changed my mind, and I could understand this book very well. Leading a team help me to see the big picture and understand how to proceed in many situations.

Some readings we do don't make sense to us when we don't have experience, so I'm assuming that a Software Engineer is not a starting level, so, maybe some examples will be difficult to understand if you're in an initial position. 

Don't worry. You can and you'll get there! But listen my first thought:

> This book told me a lot of things that today I know, but I wished someone tell me when I started as a developer.

This is a good book for people who are starting as a Software Developer and needs to understand how professional growth can work in a company. Also, this is a good book for experienced developers who want to ensure they continue growing and keep in the right direction.

### Be in charge of your career

Just want to grow is not enough. You want to be in charge of your career. This isn't the responsibility of your leader. It's yours responsibility. So, here is the second thought: 

> Think about your career growth, and try to answer where you want to stay in the next years. Don't let this decision rest with your leader.

When you know where you want to go, it's easy to choose the correct path. I know, this can be a very challenge exercise, it can be stressful, but only you can think about it. Not your colleagues, not your leader, not the company you're working. You need to be in charge of your career. 

Of course, you can ask help of an experienced person to try to clarify some paths, to understand some challenges, or even to talk about experiences, but it's only you who needs to decide where to go, how to invest time.

### Deliver value

Sometimes we do a lot of hard work, and we don't feel recognized. This causes a bad feeling and demotivation. The best way to avoid it is to stay aligned with your leader to keep in mind what is the most important thing to do to deliver value.

> Talk with your leader to understand how you can deliver value for the team, project, others engineers or the company.

Don't give up, because wanting to grow does not guarantee that you'll succeed on it. You need to ensure you'll go in the right direction, and have opportunity where you're, of course.

Asking feedback is also important to understand if you're on the right track, needs to improve some area or make some adjustments, but you need to talk about it periodically, not only before the performance review. Remember: the career is yours, so stay in charge all the time.

### Understand why

It's very bad when we start developing a new feature or a bug fix without completely understand it. We think we're productive making things faster, but no. Sometimes we fail on it. To help this, here's another thought:

> If necessary, ask why you need to achieve some objective to see the big picture. This way you can understand why, how and when you need to do something.

Make sure everything is clear making questions, talking about edge cases and side effects. Don't forget that in the code, you're the guy. Only you can reveal some details that Products folks, Designers or Stakeholders can't see.

Before the development time, it's important to understand the big picture. This way, is more likely you'll achieve the expected objective, enabling to break it into smaller parts, understanding the main difficult or challenges, and estimate them.

### Clarify to get unstuck

In my career, I already saw a lot of great developers stuck in issues, and with difficult to understand what is necessary to do. So, try to avoid this understanding your work and planning it, and don't be afraid to seek help.

> Even if a problem is big, break it to help to understand challenges and where you're working. If you don't know how to do this, seek for help.

When you have a big task and break it into smaller parts, you tend to isolate problems when they happen, because you aren't focus trying to solve the whole task, you're working in a specific part of it. This can help you to understand the real problem, and you don't get desperate in the daily meetings, because you're working in a specific part of the big problem.

Remember: you don't need to have all answers, not even a very experienced developer, but you need to be capable to break it in small parts to make a concise plan.

### Be aware what level you're

Seniority level is another important topic to talk. What's the main differences of a Software Developer from a Software Engineer? Did you already think about it? For most people, there's no difference, but I can talk a bit about it to expose what I think about. But before, think about the following:

> Understand with your leader and teammates how you are performing your work.

A Software Developer is capable to write code, make debugging, deliver some task, but a Software Engineer goes deep. It is capable to plan a feature, estimate it, discover and discuss requirements, build a solution, ship it, maintaining it, migrate. 

A Software Engineer delivers value for the team, not only for themselves. They help in guidance, taking the initiative, help the team to understand the software challenges, team collaboration, mentoring and continue learning a lot. Also, they can understand the team challenges, can understand the big picture, the objectives of a quarter and can split big tasks into smaller parts.

I believe all this is a little polemical, and sometimes subjective, because it can mess with our ego, but believe me, there's a big difference between someone who know how to write code from someone who understand why code something and how it can achieve an objective. So, ask for your leader and teammates about your delivery. Seek feedback about your job and performance. Ask for your colleagues about the perception they have about your work. 

### Isn't all about code

Usually, we think the way we'll grow faster is by learning some technology, framework or design pattern, but we forget that we work with people in a team, so we need to improve some soft skills, for instance, communication (asynchronous and synchronous), time management, collaboration. So, keep in mind the following:

> Even you're working as a developer, you'll deal with people, and human skills are very important to grow, to make yourself understood.

Isn't only you and the machine. There's a team with you. Don't forget it. So, always communicate well giving updates on your issues, meetings and documenting decisions. 

### Understand when a task is ready

Finishing tasks are great, but better than is to understand when a task is done. Is amazing to finish an issue and close it, but is this the end? What's next? Need I follow if my task or my bug fix was applied correctly or solve the main problem? The answer is: yes. So, one more thing to keep in mind:

> Your task is done when the objective is completed, that is, when your customer says that everything is okay thought feedback.

We always develop a product for a customer, so, we need to develop what he needs. It's simple.

### Soft skills are very important (sometimes more than hard skills)

Another polemical topic. As you grow in your career as a Software Engineer, you'll increase the impact you make. It's common to make more contributions that will impact the whole team, department, or company, impacting more people with your job. So, it's very common to use this expertise to come closer to Product folks, Designers, Stakeholders, and other Managers to understand what is really necessary to do to make a real impact on the company.

Because of it, the foundation abilities are very important to proceed beyond a Software Engineering career, like Tech Lead, and Staff roles. So, don't neglect the human skills. Put in your roadmap evolving topics like communication, time management, meeting management, stress management, collaboration, emotional intelligence, active listening, empathy, and conflict resolution are examples.

> As much as you like to just develop, make relations with other folks is inevitable to grow to create more impact.

Usually, this causes some evolving in leadership skills, and sometimes you can face to make a decision to choose where to go. But don't be afraid. This will make you stronger and more capable to face challenges.

## Conclusion

This book has dozens of great tips and advices, and I shared with you some of my thoughts about them.

Each company is different from others, and you need to understand what's the rules, and what's expected for the role you're or needs to achieve, but this is the basic and tends to work.

As I said previously, I haven't read big news on this book, but I wished someone tell me these things when I started in the IT area.

So, if you're new in this career, I highly recommend this reading to you. If you already are in a Senior, Tech Lead, or even in a Staff position, this is an excellent resource to don't forget how you achieved this role and how to proceed to keep growing.

I expect you enjoy this post and the book. See you in the next post!
