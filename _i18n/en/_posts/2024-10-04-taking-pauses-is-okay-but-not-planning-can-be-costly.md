<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello, everyone! I'm back after a short break.  Recently, I changed my routine and it became challenging to write every week.  Since I love sharing knowledge, I'm excited to be back.  This past month has given me a lot to think about, so I want to share some thoughts with you. I hope you enjoy today's post. </p>

Last month, my wife and I moved to a new city. This wasn't our first rodeo – we've moved several times in our relationship (five by my count!).  Moving is always time-consuming, so I took a short break to get settled into our new apartment, office, and routines. 

Personally, I'm not a big fan of breaks. It's easy to get used to doing nothing, especially when you're tired. However, sometimes breaks are essential for recharging and moving forward.  That's what I want to discuss today.

I thrive on routine. I schedule all my tasks and try to stick to my daily and weekly plans. Of course, unexpected things happen, but having a plan helps me readjust.

But what happens to your routine when you're moving or facing a wave of new responsibilities?  That's the big question I've grappled with these past few weeks. 

To avoid frustration, understanding the situation is crucial.  But are you truly prepared for it?  Ask yourself: what happens when your carefully laid plans need to change direction? What if you realize something can't continue? What if you need a pause before moving forward?

## Embrace the Changes

As I mentioned, I live by my calendar.  It holds my work schedule, personal appointments – everything.  It's what works for me.  Others might prefer reminders, notebooks, or even their memory (personally, I don't trust mine!). 

My recent move was only about 62 miles (100 kilometers), but it still required time and attention.  I had to accept that I wouldn't be able to focus on writing and maintaining my blog schedule consistently.  Recognizing this reality helped me avoid a lot of unnecessary frustration.

I'm a very pragmatic person. I like things planned, organized, and under control.  Much of what I faced during the move fell outside these ideals, so it was vital to mentally prepare myself.

While I did consider writing posts in advance, I had to remind myself that I'm not a machine.  I have a family, I need to prioritize my health, and sometimes life simply gets in the way.

These are simple yet crucial things to acknowledge. Failing to recognize the changes happening around you and adapt your routine accordingly can lead to intense frustration and burnout.

## The Power of the Pause

Short breaks offer a fresh perspective.  When we're caught in the flow, it's easy to overlook details. Breaks allow us to zoom out.

Taking a step back provides the opportunity to course-correct and make sure you're still on the right track. For instance, I have a career path planned out, and every three months, I dedicate time to reflect on my progress. While I have "checkpoint days" scheduled, short breaks offer additional moments for this valuable exercise. 

Whether you have designated checkpoints or take spontaneous pauses, these moments are crucial for evaluating if things are progressing as intended.

### Reflecting on Achievements

When we fall short of our goals, it's easy to feel like failures.  I'm very self-critical, so when I don't achieve something, my instinct is to assume I'm doing something wrong.

However, this isn't a healthy or productive mindset. It can seriously hinder our motivation. I'm actively working on shifting this perspective and focusing on both successes and setbacks.  The goal is to understand what's working, why something went wrong, and how to adjust.

This reflection is vital. Without it, we risk repeating the same mistakes.  And trust me, it's not easy to self-reflect, especially for us software engineers!  But developing this self-awareness is crucial, even (or perhaps especially) in a technical field. We need soft skills too.

### Embracing Necessary Changes

Sticking to a plan is great, but what happens when change is unavoidable?  Are you willing to adapt to ensure the success of your journey?

Recognizing and understanding changes – whether due to internal factors or external events – is essential for maintaining motivation. Short breaks can clear the fog and help you see the bigger picture.

By understanding *what* changed and *why*, you can make informed decisions and continue progressing on your journey.

### Reconnecting with Your Motivation

It's okay to realize that what you're doing no longer resonates with you.  Our passions and goals evolve. Regularly checking in with yourself ensures you're staying true to what motivates and excites you.

## Back on Track

Getting back into a routine after a break can be challenging. For me, it's a battle against inertia. It's so easy to get comfortable doing nothing.  But inaction leads to stagnation, and I know that ultimately, it's up to me to make things happen. 

I find that once I push through the initial resistance and stick to my routine for a few days, things start to flow naturally again. So, don't be discouraged!  The first step is always the hardest. Once you take it, the rest becomes easier.

## The Importance of Focus

It might seem counterintuitive, but I often find myself self-sabotaging. A demanding routine can lead to exhaustion, making it tempting to give up at the end of the day.  This is where discipline is critical. Without it, it's easy to lose sight of your goals and veer off track.

## Keep Moving Forward

Life is full of unexpected twists and turns. We might feel tempted to power through without pausing, but sometimes the most productive thing we can do is hit the reset button. And that's where planning comes in. It might seem counterintuitive when you're feeling overwhelmed, but having a plan, even a flexible one, can be your saving grace during times of change. Without a roadmap, even a loose one, it's incredibly easy to get lost in the chaos, lose motivation, and potentially make decisions that don't align with your long-term goals.

So, take that break when you need it, embrace the changes that come your way, and don’t be afraid to adjust your plans. The journey might not always be linear, but with a bit of focus and self-awareness, you'll keep moving forward.

See you in the next post!
