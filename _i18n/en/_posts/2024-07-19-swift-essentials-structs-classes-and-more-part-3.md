<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the first two parts of "100DaysOfSwiftUI," we explored the fundamental building blocks of Swift - variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, and closures. Now, we're ready to dive into a crucial aspect of Swift programming: structs and classes. These powerful tools allow us to create custom data structures that organize and represent real-world objects in our code.
