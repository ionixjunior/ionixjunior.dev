<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello, everyone! After a short break, I'm back. In the last few days I've changed my routine, and it got difficult to keep writing every week. I like to do this, so here I am. In the last month I had an opportunity to think about a lot of things, so, I'll share with you some of my thoghts. I hope you enjoy today's post.</p>

Last month, my wife and I decided to move to another city. Since we know each other, we already lived in a bunch of cities. Five, in my count. Move to another city consumes a lot of time, so, because of this I made a short break to organize the new apartment, the new office, and the new routine.

Personally, I don't like so much to take a break. It's easy to get used to do nothing, mainly if you're felling tired. But, in specific times, it's very important and necessary to continue move on. This is what this post is about.

For me, have a routine and keep the things working is what works. All my tasks I put on a calendar, and I try to follow my day and week based on it. I have some calendars to manage, for instance, the work calendar, the personal calendar, and the F1 calendar â€” sometimes I like to watch, but I'm not a big fan.

But how to have a routine if you're moving or if you have a lot of new daily tasks coming? This is a big question, and I had to deal with this in the last weeks. To avoid frustration, understand the situation is crucial, but are you prepared to this? Think about it: you make a plan and follow it. What do you do if you need to change direction? What do you do if you see something can't be continued? What do you do if you need to make a short break before continue?

## Understand the changes

As I said previously, I put all my task on an agenda. This is what works for me. Some people prefer reminders, take some notes on a notebook, or just to keep it in memory. I'm not trust in my memory. I need to write down in some place. In my case, I move to another city. It's just 62 miles (ca. 100 km) from the previous city that I lived. It's nearby, but I needed to be away sometimes to deal new apartment things. This means maybe I haven't time to focus on study and write properly and keep consistent my blog post routine. Definitely, I haven't time, but I need to understand this to avoid frustration.

I'm very pragmatic person, so, I like the things planned, organized, and under control. Most part of the things I've faced in the last weeks didn't have these characteristics, so it was very important to prepare myself to deal with these situations before they happen.

Of course, I think to write some blog posts previously to ensure that I wouldn't break the sequence of posts released every week, but I'm not a machine. I have family, I have to care about my health, I have to rest, the life continues.

All of these things are very simple, but important to talk about. If you don't understand the changes you're facing, and you need to change your routine, maybe you'll feel frustrating trying to keep all working, and probably, you'll feel very worn try keeping everything.
