<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello, everyone! After a short break, I'm back. In the last few days I've changed my routine, and it got difficult to keep writing every week. I like to do this, so here I am. In the last month I had an opportunity to think about a lot of things, so, I'll share with you some of my thoughts. I hope you enjoy today's post.</p>

Last month, my wife and I decided to move to another city. Since we know each other, we already lived in a bunch of cities. Five, in my count. Move to another city consumes a lot of time, so, because of this I made a short break to organize the new apartment, the new office, and the new routine.

Personally, I don't like so much to take a break. It's easy to get used to do nothing, mainly if you're felling tired. But, in specific times, it's very important and necessary to continue move on. This is what this post is about.

For me, have a routine and keep the things working is what works. All my tasks I put on a calendar, and I try to follow my day and week based on it. I have some calendars to manage, for instance, the work calendar, the personal calendar, and the F1 calendar — sometimes I like to watch, but I'm not a big fan.

But how to have a routine if you're moving or if you have a lot of new daily tasks coming? This is a big question, and I had to deal with this in the last weeks. To avoid frustration, understand the situation is crucial, but are you prepared to this? Think about it: you make a plan and want to follow it. What do you do if you need to change the direction? What do you do if you see something can't be continued? What do you do if you need to make a short break before continue?

## Understand the changes

As I said previously, I put all my task on an agenda. This is what works for me. Some people prefer reminders, take some notes on a notebook, or just to keep it in memory. I'm not trust in my memory. I need to write down in some place. In my case, I move to another city. It's just 62 miles (ca. 100 km) from the previous city that I lived. It's nearby, but I needed to be away sometimes to deal new apartment things. This means maybe I haven't time to focus on study and write properly and keep consistent my blog post routine. Definitely, I haven't time, but I need to understand this to avoid frustration.

I'm a very pragmatic person, so, I like the things planned, organized, and under control. Most part of the things I've faced in the last weeks didn't have these characteristics, so it was very important to prepare myself to deal with these situations before they happen.

Of course, I thought to write some blog posts previously to ensure that I wouldn't break the sequence of posts released every week, but I'm not a machine. I have family, I have to care about my health, I have to rest, the life doesn't stop.

All of these things are very simple, but important to talk about. If you don't understand the changes you're facing, and you need to change your routine, maybe you'll feel frustrating trying to keep all working, and probably, you'll feel very worn try keeping everything.

## Make a short break

Short breaks are good to take a look what you're doing from another perspective. When we're on the flow, sometimes can be difficult to pay attention on details, and these times are good for this.

When you pay attention on what you're doing, you can have a chance to fix directions and ensure you'll continue on the right path. I have a career path planned, and in every three months I have a meeting with myself to think about my evolution. I planned a “checkpoint day” on my calendar to do this, but short breaks can be good times to make this reflection too.

Anyway, independent if you prepare some checkpoints or make a short break to think about how your planning is going, this moment is important to you understand if the thinks are happening as planned.

### Thinking about your achievements

When we can't achieve all we planned in a specific period of time, it's common to think we're failing, or we're lost. Well, I'm usually criticizing myself a lot, so when I feel that I didn't achieve something, generally I think I'm doing something wrong.

This is not a good way to think about our evolution. Also, this can disturb us to keep going. I'm working to improve this on myself, and I'm trying to always see what goes correct and what goes wrong. Basically, what goes correct I try to keep and what goes wrong I think why and try to find an alternative. 

This reflection is important, because if you don't think about it, probably you'll keep continue doing the same, even the things are going bad.

### Thinking about what changed

When we make a plan, is totally desirable to keep the plan until the end. But, what happens if something change or needs to change? Will you continue on the main plan or will rethink your plan to ensure the success of your journey? 

Understand the changes is crucial to ensure you keep motivated and in the right path. Changes can be from our results or from external events, so these short breaks can be useful to refresh your mind and see things more clearly.

When you understand what changed and why, you can make new deal with yourself and continue on your evolution's path.

### Thinking about what motivate us

It's not a problem after a period of time if you understand what you're doing is not what is making sense to you right now. The things change. Our perception and wishes changes. So, keep in mind what motive you and ensure you'll continue what makes you happy and engaged on your journey.

## Remembering your goals
- have a good plan and good goals is important
- think about how can I introduce PDI facts

## Go back to the routine

For me, it's a lazy time. When I pause a frantic routine, It's easy to get used to do nothing, and it's a little bit difficult for me to go back on the rails. But if I don't do anything, nothing happens, so I know this only depends on me. Because of this, I'm here back writing again. 

I need only a couple of times keeping the routine, and them everything happen normally after a few times. The difficult part is start or go back doing some activity.

## Stay focus


## Distraction matters
