<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>while ago I did 100 Days of Swift from Paul Hudson. It was an amazing time that I learn a lot about Swift and iOS development. In todas's post I'll share my thoughts about this journey, telling you the highlights. Let's see it!</p>

If you look on internet about "100 days of Swift", you'll find various content. When I've looked for it, I choose one from Paul Hudson. [Here][100_days_of_swift] is it. I remembered some people ask me "why do you start with this journey instead of SwiftUI?". Well, I believe both is important (UIKit and SwiftUI), so I prefer to start with UIKit.

If you are starting, I highly recommend you to choose a path something like this. In this path you'll be facing challenges, you'll practice, every day you'll do something different. The dynamics are: every day you'll learn something and practice it. It's simple. I'll share with you the highlights of my journey.

## The First 12 Days

The first 12 days was dedicated to Swift basics, but even a very simple content, I've learned something's.

### Make Large Numbers Legible

If you are working with large numbers, you can use underscores as thousands separators. This don't change the number, just make it easier to read.

{%- highlight swift -%}
var balance = 10_000_000
{%- endhighlight -%}

### Exiting Multiple Loops

If you have multiple nested loops, you can name each one to create a break condition to exit. I'm feeling using `go to` (do you remember)? üòÖ

{%- highlight swift -%}
outerLoop: for i in 1...5 {
    for j in 1...5 {
        print ("\ (i) - \(j)")

        if j == 3 {
            break outerLoop
        }
    }
}        
{%- endhighlight -%}

This was very simple things, but I thought interesting.

## Starting With iOS Projects

After the Swift basics, I've started with iOS projects, and explore a lot of contents. Let's remember the coolest.

### Environment Overrides

Xcode has an option called ‚Äúenvironment overrides‚Äù. Basically, you can change some configuration on appearance, text, and accessibility to test your app when running. Very easy to check you app in different scenarios.

<video controls aria-labelledby="Xcode Environment Overrides" aria-describedby="The video show Xcode and iOS Simulator side by side. The app is running, and there is a button at a bottom Xcode's toolbar that how the environment overrides tool. When you change the configuration, you see the changes directily on the running app.">
    <source src="/assets/videos/xcode_environment_overrides.mp4" type="video/mp4">

### Debug Description on UI Tests

When you're running UI tests, you can put a breakpoint in some line and type `po app.debugDescription` on output window. You'll see something like a ‚ÄúREPL‚Äù to understand the elements you can interact on screen. Useful when you need to understand the elements on UI.

### Unresponsiveness UI

This was a very interesting thing. Xcode tell me that I made an expensive operation using UI thread, like load a URL from internet. This type of thing is very easy to fix, I like Xcode show me this warning to improve my implementation.

### River Ride - little version

In additional to UIKit, I saw I little about SpriteKit too. It was very funny.

<video controls aria-labelledby="River Ride Little make with SpriteKit" aria-describedby="The video show Xcode and iOS Simulator side by side. The app was made using SpriteKit and is a little version of River Ride game.">
    <source src="/assets/videos/river_rider_little_made_by_spritekit.mp4" type="video/mp4">

### Memory Game

Also, I've created a simple memory game. To test this, I've developed UI tests to check if all cards can be flipped and if the game is finished. Very funny too.

<video controls aria-labelledby="A memory game tested with UI Tests" aria-describedby="The video show Xcode and iPad Simulator. The app was made using UIKit and is a memory game. The UI tests open all pairs until the game is finished.">

## 100 Days Practicing == Great Evolve

Some chapters of this training was very repetitive, but it has an objective: establish knowledge. Before I start this journey, I had a feeling that I need to keep developing anything every day, to learn, and practice day to day. So, the 100 days of Swift was a good idea to follow and learn about good content.

If you can follow all my journey, you can see [this tweet][100_days_of_swift_journey].

I am thinking to start [100 days of SwiftUI][100_days_of_swiftui] made from Paul Hudson. What do you think? Will you come with me on this journey?
