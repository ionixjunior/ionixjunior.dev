<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore the end of the year seems the perfect moment to reflect on what things we did along the year. I believe this was the first year I made this reflection and I'll share with you some of my throughts. Let's talk about the 2024 year from my career perspective.</p>

## Blog posts

Since January, I've started to write on my blog again. Initially, I choose a topic that I like too much: Git. I made a lot of posts talking about the Git commands. Also, I wrote post about iOS development, and career. I like to share content, but the best part of it is interacting with you through comments. So, thank you so much for all of you who interact with me commenting in the posts both on the blog and on [LinkedIn][my_linkedin].

## Live Streaming

This year I didn't create any live-streaming on my [YouTube][my_youtube] and [Twitch][my_twitch] channels, but I participated in 6 live-streaming in [Canal .NET][canal_dotnet] and [Azure Brasil][azure_brasil] channels. I've appreciated all these moments, and I'd like to thanks to the opportunity.

Here are the links of these live-streaming.

## Podcast

This year a colleague called Fernando Okuma invite me to participate in a edition of Lambda3 podcast. It was an amazing experience to talk with him about Git. Thank you so much for invite me! Bellow the link to listen.

## iOS Study

In 2024, I focused time to learn and practice about iOS development. I saw a lot of great content, and I'll share with you some of them.

### Courses

I made some long and short courses. 

#### Backfront Plus

First, I started a course at [Backfront Plus][backfront_plus]. This platform contains a lot of great courses about mobile development, and I found an amazing content there. UIKit, ViewCode, and SwiftUI are some of them. If you're looking for good content for a fair price, that's the platform. Just for information: this isn't a paid post, right? This is a genuine report. I liked a lot this platform.

#### Functional Programming with Swift

A good content that I found on LinkedIn Learning was the short course called [Learning Functional Programming with Swift][learning_functional_programming_with_swift]. This course was very simple, but very good to understand and practice about functional programming using Swift.

#### iOS Development: Architecture

In this course, I saw some fundamental architectural design patterns, SOLID principles, how to build responsive apps, and more concepts about iOS development. It was a good course to know a lot of details applied to the platform. If you're interested, here's the link: [iOS Development: Architecture][ios_development_architecture].

#### 100 Days Of SwiftUI

Another great content that I watched a lot was from Paul Hudson. I've started the [100 Days Of SwiftUI][100_days_of_swiftui], but unfortunately I didn't finish it yet. After I moved to Brasília my routine changed, and I needed to rethink my study plan. But if you're looking for great free content, that's it.

### Book

I read an amazing book called [Testing Swift][testing_swift], from Paul Hudson. I highly recommend reading it. This book has a smooth reading, easy to understand and with great examples. It's incredible to think how easy can be to test iOS apps, and this book helps a lot in this task.

I did others readings too, but they aren't technical, so I won't describe it here.

### Open-source contribution

Different from other times, I didn't start any clone app projects this year. Instead, I started to contribute in an open-source project, programming in a real software. I found at [Firefox iOS][firefox_ios] project a nice community to start contributing, and I jumped in.

I started contributing in small PRs, off course. The first PR, I started refactoring a font reference, and then I started solving some linter issues. Today I continue helping in linter issues, but I'm committed with a big refactor, and this is being amazing, and I'm learning a lot with this great team.

Along this year, I made more than 40 PRs helping the Firefox iOS team to enable some linter rules, making font updates, and solving a flaky unit test. So, thank you so much for all Firefox iOS team members to be patient and help me to achieve the goals! All of you are making a great work and have a well-organized project.

## CI/CD Study

Recently I faced some challenges using Azure DevOps Pipelines to build an app, and I found a course at Udemy called [Azure Pipelines - CI/CD, Docker and Kubernetes in Azure DevOps][azure_pipelines]. This is a good course to understand Azure Pipelines, from beginning to advance. Sincerely, I didn't practice some lessons, because what I needed was very specific topic, but if you need a more advanced topic this is a great course to check out. 

## Leave Team Leadership

The 2024 year was a year to start another career change. Since 2020 I'm working as a Team Leader. In this role, I faced a lot of challenges, and this made me grow a lot in soft skills — communication, difficult conversations, emotional intelligence, time management, team management, delegation. I fell these abilities very neglected by developers sometimes, but it helps to grow a lot in our career, manly for people who work from home.

After this period leading a team, I felt the need to start thinking again in my personal grow in the tech career. So, since the end of 2023, I started a conversation with my leadership, and we create a plan to find another leader for the team to enable me to go back to focus on mobile development. Now at the end of 2024, we found one, and this will enable me to finish my plan at the beginning of 2025.

## 2025 Comes

The 2024 year is ending, and 2025 comes. Now, it's the best time to think about all things we did, all that works or not, and think about the next year, ensuring we'll choose a path that makes sense for us.

Thank you for your attention, and see you in the next year!
