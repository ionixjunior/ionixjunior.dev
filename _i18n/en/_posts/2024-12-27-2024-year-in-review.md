<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore the end of the year seems the perfect moment to reflect on what things we did during the year. I believe this was the first year I made this reflection and I'll share with you some of my throughts. Let's talk about the 2024 year from my career perspective.</p>

## Blog posts

Since January, I've started to write on my blog again. I choose a topic that I like too much: git. It was 32 blog posts talking about git, iOS development, and career. I like to share content, but the best think is when you share what you're thinking about thought comments. So, thank you for your time spending reading and commenting on it. Some data just for curiosity: 

### The most viewed post 

The most viewed post was [Git Branching Strategies: A Comprehensive Guide][the_most_viewed_post] with more than 1300 views during this year.

### Where's the audience

THINK ABOUT THIS.

## Live Streaming

This year I didn't create any live-streaming on my [YouTube][my_youtube] and [Twitch][my_twitch] channels, but I participated in 6 live-streaming in [Canal .NET][canal_dotnet] and [Azure Brasil][azure_brasil] channels. I've appreciated all these moments, and I'd like to thanks to the opportunity.

## iOS Study

### Course

This year was the year that I focus time to learn and practice about iOS development. First, I started a course at [Backfront Plus][backfront_plus]. This platform contains a lot of great courses about iOS and Android development, and I found a great content about iOS development there. If you're looking for good content for a fair price, that's the platform. Just for information: this isn't a paid post, right? This is a genuine report.

### Journey

Another great content that I watched a lot is from Paul Hudson. I've started the [100 Days Of SwiftUI][100_days_of_swiftui], but unfortunately I didn't finish it yet. After I moved to Bras√≠lia my routine changed, and I needed to change my routine. But if you're looking for great free content, is there.

### Practice

Different from other times, I didn't start any clone interface project this year. Instead, I started to contribute in an open-source project, programming in a real software. I found at [Firefox iOS][firefox_ios] a nice community to start contributing, and I jumped in.

I started contributing in small PRs, off course. The first PR I started refactoring a font reference, and then I started solving some linter issues. Today I continue solving some linter issues, but I'm committed with a big refactor, and this is being amazing, and I'm learning a lot with this great team.

So, thank you so much for all Firefox iOS team to be patient and help me to achieve the goals! All of you are making a great work and have a well-organized project.
