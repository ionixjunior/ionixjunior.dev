<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here's a lot of things to study if you choose any Software Engineering position. You can develop desktop, web, mobile, iot applications, and each of this options have huge possibilities to you choose or specialize. A common question, mainly for a newbie, is: when I'll be a master in this technology? This is a difficult questions to answer, isn't it? Well, actualy I believe we never will master all the thing we work or study. Technology evolves fast and all the time we face the things change. This can cause some nervous and strees, because is a little bit difficult to not get the things under control. So, in today's post I'll share some of my thoughts about it. Take a coffee or any drink do you prefer, have a seat, and let's get started.</p>
