<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here's a lot of things to study if you choose any Software Engineering position. You can develop desktop, web, mobile, IoT applications, and each of these options have huge possibilities to you choose or specialize. A common question, mainly for a newbie is: when I'll be a master in this technology? This is a difficult question to answer, isn't it? Well, actualy I believe we never will master all the thing we work or study. Technology evolves fast and all the time we face the things changing. This can cause some nervous and strees, because is a little bit difficult to not get the things under control. So, in today's post I'll share some of my thoughts about it. Take a coffee or any drink do you prefer, have a seat, and let's get started.</p>

I've working with software development since 2008. I already worked in six different companies, and I felt I and my colleagues looking for the same objective: be master in some technology. Everybody who wants to learn, usually, wants to be a master in some subject, but how fast can we achieve this to receive the long-awaited promotion or simple to get a new job? 

Well, all of us, IT guys, love to say: it depends! That's the absolute truth for this question. It depends, because each of us have different ways to learn. Some people like to learn by watching videos, another one like to learn by reading blog posts, other people like to roll up the sleeves and dive into the code. So, it depends. Do you agree with this?

Another thing that I believe is very important to understand: learning is different from knowing. You can watch a bunch of videos about some specific content, and that's ok. You learn about it. But did you really understand it? Do you really know about it? You watched some course in 2x velocity and are you prepared for the fight? If you need to get your hands dirty, can you put in practice what you've learned? Did you really learn the concepts?

And last, but not least: the time. This is another factor in the equation. Most of us wants to learn very fast, but is learning a lot of things and fast enough to feel safe and comfortable in our position?

I believe not, and I'll try to explain my point of view.

## My Point Of View

When we want to learn something or wants to achieve an objective, we create expectations. We want to change, to make a career transition, to learn a new technology or just to start in the field. Sometimes we know what we want, but we don't know how to achieve this. So, in this case is very common to immerse yourself in studying everything you come across. Do you want to achieve your objective, right? How much time do you believe you'll need to get it? Three or six months? One year? And what's your plan B? Do you have one? It's not difficult to start trying learning all the things, but if you don't have a clear path, you can get only anxiety and fear. 

This usually happen when you're trying to bite off more than you can chew. Learning a lot of things doesn't mean knowing these things. You need to practice, and you need time to develop the new abilities. This can cause anxiety, because if you don't have a clear path, you can see there's a lot of new things to learn. You start learning just only one new thing, and you discover there's more five our ten new concepts to looking for. That's ok! You're not alone. If you don't have a clear path to focus on what's more important, you can feel a little anxious, because you won't stop to look for new content. All you'll see ins't enough, and you won't enjoy your journey. This is terrible.

It can cause fear too. If you understand that always exists a lot of things to learn, and you don't feel confident with you knowledge, how can you work properly if you always is concerned about your own knowledge?

So, “learn fast and all the things, but understand nothing”. That's a common behavior that I can see in many people. If you're facing this, don't worry. Let's talk about it and help each other.

## You Can Learn With Your Mistakes

I already faced this situation in different stages of my career. The first one in 2008 when I started in the field as a Web Developer. In that year I was almost as a Webmaster, because I needed to learn about web applications, databases, manage Linux servers, and all the things that an IT guy do — including fix printers. At the beginning of my career, I had not a clear path to follow, I just learn a lot of things, fast and practice a lot. I learned a lot practicing, and I worked all the time. It was very tiring, but I evolved a lot.

The second stage of my career that I faced a change was in 2014 when I started as a Mobile Developer working with Xamarin Forms. I had a challenge to develop a sales representative application for Android, iOS, and Windows, but as a Web Developer, I had no idea what was necessary to learn, so I started again to learn and practice a lot. In this period, I was always worried about learning mobile development. It was a period of time that I've grown a lot again, but it costs my mental heath. Some people can think this is bullshit, but anybody can tell me what I felt, only I know.

In 2019, I make a new move, and start as a Mobile Engineer. Despite I continue working with mobile development, there was something different: I started to work more close to the native Android and iOS APIs. I started to work all day with Xamarin Traditional approach. This may seem like nothing, but it was a big change for me. I felt I didn't have good knowledge enough to stay there. Sincerely, I knew that I had a good knowledge about software development, but not about mobile development, because I had working with Xamarin Forms for a long time. So, I needed to start to learn again. Tiring, isn't it? Well, but this time was different to me, because I was (and continue) in a good place, and it provides me to finally enjoy my learning path.

TALK ABOUT THE IOS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING POSITION TRANSITION?

I was determined to try something different. I didn't want to repeat the same cycle.

## Calm Down And Enjoy The Learning Path

To keep calm and enjoy the learning path, I accept that I never will be a master on all the things. This was very difficult for me, because I put a lot of pressure on myself. I want to be the best, so accept this was not easy.

What is working to me is to think about the following questions: 

1. What knowledge I need to develop to make myself confident and allow me to move on?
1. Where and how can I get this new knowledge?
1. How much time I'll invest to achieve this?

Is it difficult to answer these questions? If you don't have the habit or ability to reflect about yourself, this can be a big challenge. You need to know about yourself, what do you want, and how much are you willing to sacrifice. This can be difficult, but understand this is very important. Let's explore these questions.

### 1. What knowledge I need to develop to make myself confident and allow me to move on?

This is very particular for each one. You need to think what knowledge you'll focus to learn and practice that will make you more confident and prepared for the challenges on your career. So, think: what do you want to learn? 

Do you want to learn about backend development? Maybe you should to start learning about the basics of databases, HTTP protocol and Restful APIs.

Do you want to learn about frontend development? Maybe you should to start learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.

Do you want to learn about mobile development? Maybe you should to start learning about the basic screen components and navigation.

You need to choose what path you need to follow, and understand what knowledge you need to learn that allow you to move on without problems.

### 2. Where and how can I get this new knowledge?

Today there's a lot of resources that you can use to learn about anything. YouTube's videos, blog posts, courses at LinkedIn Learn, Pluralsight, Udemy, Alura, BackFront Plus. I think this topic a little bit interesting, because I was born in 1987, and I grew without the new technologies that we use today. My first computer I won with 15 years old, and the internet was dial-up. Today we turn on our computers and smartphones, and all the time we're connected, with a lot of content on the palm of our hands. But even with a lot of content to consume, I think sometimes we don't know where to find good contents or where to start.

### 3. How much time I'll invest to achieve this?

Now you already know what knowledge you'll want to develop, where is the resources, and you need to think how much time you'll invest to achieve this. How much time? One hour per day? Two, maybe? Between three and six hours per week? You need to organize your agenda and put your learning path into your routine. Don't you have time at the moment? No problem, but you can't feel frustrating with this, and this situation needs to be very clear to you. 

### Things to care about

Focus means when you set a target and follow it. So, if you plan to study a lot of things, maybe you're starting wrong. I am telling this because is humanly impossible start learning many things at the same time, and you be productive in all of them.
