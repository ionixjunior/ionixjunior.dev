<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here's a lot of things to study if you choose any Software Engineering position. You can develop desktop, web, mobile, IoT applications, and each of these options have huge possibilities to you choose or specialize. A common question, mainly for a newbie is: when I'll be a master in this technology? This is a difficult question to answer, isn't it? Well, actualy I believe we never will master all the thing we work or study. Technology evolves fast and all the time we face the things changing. This can cause some nervous and strees, because is a little bit difficult to not get the things under control. So, in today's post I'll share some of my thoughts about it. Take a coffee or any drink do you prefer, have a seat, and let's get started.</p>

I've working with software development since 2008. I already worked in six different companies, and I felt I and my colleagues looking for the same objective: be master in some technology. Everybody who wants to learn, usually, wants to be a master in some subject, but how fast can we achieve this to receive the long-awaited promotion or simple to get a new job? 

Well, all of us, IT guys, love to say: it depends! That's the absolute truth for this question. It depends, because each of us have different ways to learn. Some people like to learn by watching videos, another one like to learn by reading blog posts, other people like to roll up the sleeves and dive into the code. So, it depends. Do you agree with this?

Another thing that I believe is very important to understand: learning is different from knowing. You can watch a bunch of videos about some specific content, and that's ok. You learn about it. But did you really understand it? Do you really know about it? You watched some course in 2x velocity and are you prepared for the fight? If you need to get your hands dirty, can you put in practice what you've learned? Did you really learn the concepts?

And last, but not least: the time. This is another factor in the equation. Most of us wants to learn very fast, but is learning a lot of things and fast enough to feel safe and comfortable in our position?

I believe not, and I'll try to explain my point of view.

## My Point Of View

When we want to learn something or wants to achieve an objective, we create expectations. We want to change, to make a career transition, to learn a new technology or just to start in the field. Sometimes we know what we want, but we don't know how to achieve this. So, in this case is very common to immerse yourself in studying everything you come across. Do you want to achieve your objective, right? How much time do you believe you'll need to get it? Three or six months? One year? And what's your plan B? Do you have one? It's not difficult to start trying learning all the things, but if you don't have a clear path, you can get only anxiety and fear. 

This usually happen when you're trying to bite off more than you can chew. Learning a lot of things doesn't mean knowing these things. You need to practice, and you need time to develop the new abilities. This can cause anxiety, because if you don't have a clear path, you can see there's a lot of new things to learn. You start learning just only one new thing, and you discover there's more five our ten new concepts to looking for. That's ok! You're not alone. If you don't have a clear path to focus on what's more important, you can feel a little anxious, because you won't stop to look for new content. All you'll see ins't enough, and you won't enjoy your journey. This is terrible.

It can cause fear too. If you understand that always exists a lot of things to learn, and you don't feel confident with you knowledge, how can you work properly if you always is concerned about your own knowledge?

So, “learn fast and all the things, but understand nothing”. That's a common behavior that I can see in many people. If you're facing this, don't worry. Let's talk about it and help each other.

## You Can Learn With Your Mistakes

I already faced this situation in different stages of my career. The first one in 2008 when I started in the field as a Web Developer. In that year I was almost as a Webmaster, because I needed to learn about web applications, databases, manage Linux servers, and all the things that an IT guy do — including fix printers. At the beginning of my career, I had not a clear path to follow, I just learn a lot of things, fast and practice a lot. I learned a lot practicing, and I worked all the time. It was very tiring, but I evolved a lot.

The second stage of my career that I faced a change was in 2014 when I started as a Mobile Developer working with Xamarin Forms. I had a challenge to develop a sales representative application for Android, iOS, and Windows, but as a Web Developer, I had no idea what was necessary to learn, so I started again to learn and practice a lot. In this period, I was always worried about learning mobile development. It was a period of time that I've grown a lot again, but it costs my mental heath. Some people can think this is bullshit, but anybody can tell me what I felt, only I know.

In 2019, I make a new move, and start as a Mobile Engineer. Despite I continue working with mobile development, there was something different: I started to work more close to the native Android and iOS APIs. I started to work all day with Xamarin Traditional approach. This may seem like nothing, but it was a big change for me. I felt I didn't have good knowledge enough to stay there. Sincerely, I knew that I had a good knowledge about software development, but not about mobile development, because I had working with Xamarin Forms for a long time. So, I needed to start to learn again. Tiring, isn't it? Well, but this time was different to me, because I was (and continue) in a good place, and it provides me to finally enjoy my learning path.

I was determined to try something different in 2019. I didn't want to repeat the same cycle.

## Calm Down And Enjoy The Learning Path

To keep calm and enjoy the learning path, I accept that I never will be a master on all the things. This was very difficult for me, because I put a lot of pressure on myself. I want to be the best, so accept this was not easy.

What is working to me is to think about the following questions: 

1. What knowledge I need to develop to make myself confident and allow me to move on?
1. Where and how can I get this new knowledge?
1. How much time I'll invest to achieve this?

Is it difficult to answer these questions? If you don't have the habit or ability to reflect about yourself, this can be a big challenge. You need to know about yourself, what do you want, and how much are you willing to sacrifice. This can be difficult, but understand this is very important. Let's explore these questions.

### 1. What knowledge I need to develop to make myself confident and allow me to move on?

This is very particular for each one. You need to think what knowledge you'll focus to learn and practice that will make you more confident and prepared for the challenges on your career. So, think: what do you want to learn? 

Do you want to learn about backend development? Maybe you should to start learning about the basics of databases, HTTP protocol and Restful APIs.

Do you want to learn about frontend development? Maybe you should to start learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.

Do you want to learn about mobile development? Maybe you should to start learning about the basic screen components and navigation.

You need to choose what path you need to follow, and understand what knowledge you need to learn that allow you to move on without problems.

### 2. Where and how can I get this new knowledge?

Today there's a lot of resources that you can use to learn about anything. YouTube's videos, blog posts, courses at [LinkedIn Learning][linkedin_learning], [Pluralsight][pluralsight], [Udemy][udemy], [Alura][alura], [BackFront Plus][backfrontplus], or even free content on YouTube. I think this topic a little bit interesting, because I was born in 1987, and I grew without the new technologies that we use today. My first computer I won with 15 years old, and the internet was dial-up. Today we turn on our computers and smartphones, and all the time we're connected, with a lot of content on the palm of our hands. But even with a lot of content to consume, I think sometimes we don't know where to find good contents or where to start.

### 3. How much time I'll invest to achieve this?

Now you already know what knowledge you'll want to develop, where is the resources, and you need to think how much time you'll invest to achieve this. How much time? One hour per day? Two, maybe? Between three and six hours per week? You need to organize your agenda and put your learning path into your routine. Don't you have time at the moment? No problem, but you can't feel frustrating with this, and this situation needs to be very clear to you. 

### Things to care about

Focus means when you set a target and follow it. So, if you plan to study a lot of things, maybe you're starting wrong, or won't achieve your plans properly. I am telling this because is humanly impossible start learning many things at the same time, and you be productive in all of them. There are some exceptions, but focus means start something and ensure to evolve it until finish. Think about it.

## Sharing Experiences

I've dedicated this session to share my last experiences. Maybe something can help you to clear the learning path.

### Experience 1: Start Working With iOS And Android Native APIs

As I said previously, in 2019 I started as a Mobile Engineer to work with Xamarin Traditional, more closely to iOS and Android native APIs. This was a great challenge to me, because I was used to working only with Xamarin Forms. At that time, Xamarin Forms was very evolved, and each new application didn't need a lot of custom renderers to work property anymore. This means that the native knowledge it wasn't so necessary, and developers could focus on share code most part of time.

Well, my scenario changed, and I needed a plan to study. I knew I needed to study a lot of things, but I tried to answer the three questions.

#### 1. What knowledge I need to develop to make myself confident and allow me to move on?

This is very strange, but for me, to feel comfortable, I didn't need much:

- Master how to create screen with dynamic lists (images, text, buttons).
- Master how to navigate between screens.
- Master how to communicate between screens.

Very simple, right? Yeah, simple, but I needed to master these things to feel more comfortable on my new job. I knew all the concepts, but I didn't work with this until that moment. There's a big difference when you only learn about something than you really understand about it. All of this knowledge I needed to evolve in both platforms, but more on iOS.

#### 2. Where and how can I get this new knowledge?

Well, I don't remember exactly where I study, but I remember to looking for courses at Udemy, Pluralsight and a some contents on YouTube. All very practical training. On Pluralsight I remember to do the following courses:

- [Swift Fundamentals][ps_swift]
- [iOS 11 Fundamentals][ps_ios]
- [iOS Collection Views: Getting Started][ps_collectionview]
- [iOS Data Persistence: The Big Picture][ps_data]
- [iOS Networking with REST APIs][ps_netwworking]
- [iOS Auto Layout Fundamentals][ps_autolayout] - 36%
- [Developing Android Applications with Kotlin: Getting Started][ps_android]
- [Android Apps with Kotlin: Tools and Testing][ps_android_tests]
- [Android Apps with Kotlin: RecyclerView and Navigation Drawer][ps_android_rv] - 67%

#### 3. How much time I'll invest to achieve this?

I usually dedicate many hours to studying. This is how works to me. When I face a new challenge, I like to deep dive into it. I have the privilege of being able to find time for this. My wife support me and helps me a lot. I usually dedicate between one and two hours a day, including weekends, because my wife loves to wake up late, and I wake up early to study more time when we stay home.

I hope to see progress in about a year, and this comes. Over time, the tasks became easier. This was sign to me that I am achieving my objective. I continue studying and evolving, but with less pressure on myself.

These basics staff helps me to continue growing on my position. Maybe you're thinking: why do you study iOS and Android native approach with Swift and Kotlin instead of C# with Xamarin? Well, I believe if you master the native development and understand how each platform works, you will reduce the doubt when you're facing problems on mobile development with Xamarin. Something goes wrong? What's wrong? Is Xamarin or is iOS / Android? Understand the core concepts in the native language helps me a lot of times to not blame Xamarin when I face problems. I've seen it sometimes occurs with people blaming Xamarin Forms, but the real problem are on the platforms.

### Experience 2: Start To Focus On Master iOS Development With Swift

Last year I wrote about it, and you can find this post [here][csharp_to_swift]. So, here I am thinking about the questions again.

#### 1. What knowledge I need to develop to make myself confident and allow me to move on?

Over the last few years working with Xamarin Traditional, I've learned a lot about iOS, but now I have some specific necessities to feel comfortable to be an iOS Engineer in the future. For example:

- Master about closures in Swift
- Master about View Code
- Master about SwiftUI
- Master about memory management
- Master about parallelism and concurrency

#### 2. Where and how can I get this new knowledge?

For my surprise, I found a lot of content on LinkedIn Learning, but I've started this journey using the [BackFront Plus][backfrontplus]. They have a great paid content, and the videos about iOS development are fantastic, very well explained. If you have opportunity, I really recommend it to you. 

Also, I like content of [Paul Hudson][hawkingwithswift]. He has a lot of free great content. The same is for [Sean Allen][sean_allen], and [CodeWithChris][code_with_chris].

Another interesting think that I'm trying now is to practice in a real project. I like so much to create a project from scratch, and test concepts on it. But there's a problem: when you're in a “hello world” project, learning tends to be somewhat limited. So I decided to practice trying to contribute in a real open-source project. I've share about it in [this post][open_source_post].

#### 3. How much time I'll invest to achieve this?

Today I'm investing at least one hour from Monday to Friday, and some hours on Saturday. My intention here is to study and practice until I feel confident to contribute in open-source projects. 

Confident is subjective, right? Well, I like to feel that I haven't a big difficult to understand and create some solution. That's it.

## Need Tips To Find Where Or What To Study?

There's a site called [roadmap.sh][roadmap_sh], that is a community effort to create roadmaps, guides and other educational content to help guide developers in picking up a path and guide their learnings. Check this out!

Another great resource is [a study guide for software development with Swift][study_guide_ios]. I didn't finish it, but I found great content there.

## What Will You Learn Now?

The path to mastery in tech is a journey, not a destination. It's about finding the right balance between learning and practicing, focusing on what matters most to you, and understanding that you don't need to know everything to make progress.

Embrace the power of patience and persistence — it's your key to conquering the ever-evolving tech landscape. Start by identifying what you want to learn, find the resources that suit your learning style, and dedicate the time you can to reach your goals. 

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, learn from them, and keep moving forward. Remember, every new skill you acquire adds value to your career and empowers you to build incredible things. So, take that first step, stay curious, and enjoy the learning journey!
